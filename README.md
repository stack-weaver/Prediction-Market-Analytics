## About the Project

Predly.ai is a web application for monitoring and analysing prediction-market opportunities, with AI-powered insights and real-time data. The platform supports markets from platforms such as Polymarket and Kalshi, delivering actionable analytics and assisting users in identifying favourable trades.

Key goals:

* Ingest live market data, apply ML/AI analysis
* Surface opportunities (value, anomalies, sentiment shifts)
* Visualise results in an intuitive dashboard
* Provide alerts, tracking, and decision-support

## Features

* Real-time feed of prediction market data
* AI/ML modules to detect undervalued contracts, market inefficiencies
* Dashboard with charts, trends, alerts
* Historical data analysis and back-testing
* Export / report generation functionality
* User authentication & role management
* Responsive UI for web & mobile

## Tech Stack

Here’s a suggested tech stack for this kind of project (customise it for your actual implementation):

* Front-end: React (or Next.js) + Tailwind CSS for rapid responsive UI
* Back-end: Node.js/Express (or Python FastAPI) for API endpoints
* Machine Learning / Analytics: Python (Pandas, scikit-learn, maybe TensorFlow/PyTorch)
* Database: PostgreSQL or MongoDB for structured/unstructured data
* Real-time streaming: WebSockets or Kafka/RabbitMQ for live updates
* Deployment: Docker containers, AWS (EC2, S3, RDS) or another cloud provider
* CI/CD: GitHub Actions or Jenkins for deployment automation

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have:

* Node.js (e.g., v18+)
* npm or yarn
* Python (e.g., 3.10+) if ML parts are separate
* Docker (optional, for containerised setup)
* Access credentials for data sources (Polymarket API, Kalshi API, etc)
* PostgreSQL or MongoDB running (or connection string to cloud DB)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/predly-ai.git  
   cd predly-ai  
   ```
2. Install dependencies (front-end):

   ```bash
   cd frontend  
   npm install  
   ```

   And for back-end:

   ```bash
   cd ../backend  
   npm install  
   ```

   If you have a separate ML/analytics service:

   ```bash
   cd ../analytics  
   pip install -r requirements.txt  
   ```
3. Configure environment variables (see [Configuration](#configuration--environment-variables) below).
4. Run the application:

   ```bash
   # in backend  
   npm run dev  

   # in frontend  
   npm run start  
   ```

   Or use Docker:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build  
   ```

## Usage

Once running, open your browser at `http://localhost:3000` (or the configured port). You should see a dashboard showing live market feeds, AI-insights, charts, etc.

* Register or login as a user.
* Navigate to the “Markets” tab to view current prediction markets streaming in.
* Use the “Insights” tab to see AI-identified opportunities, flagged anomalies, and suggested actions.
* Export reports or set alerts for markets you care about.

## Configuration & Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file (do **not** commit credentials). Example variables:

```text
# Backend  
PORT=5000  
DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:password@host:port/dbname  
JWT_SECRET=your_secret_key  
POLYMARKET_API_KEY=xxxxxxx  
KALSHI_API_KEY=yyyyyyy  

# Frontend  
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000  
```

For ML/Analytics service:

```text
ML_MODEL_PATH=/models/latest.pkl  
STREAMING_SOURCE_URL=wss://stream.predly.ai/markets  
```

## Architecture Overview

Below is a high-level view of the system architecture:

1. **Data Ingestion Layer**: Connects to prediction market platforms (Polymarket, Kalshi, etc), fetches streaming/REST data.
2. **Data Storage**: Raw market tick data stored in a time-series or relational DB, processed data stored for analytics.
3. **Analytics / AI Engine**: Runs models (time series, anomaly detection, classification) to identify opportunistic trades.
4. **API Layer**: Back-end exposes endpoints for front-end, analytics, user management.
5. **Front-end UI**: Renders dashboards, allows interaction, alerts, and exports.
6. **User Management & Alerts**: Handles authentication, roles, subscription to alerts (email/push).
7. **Deployment & Monitoring**: Containerised services, logging, monitoring (Prometheus/Grafana) for health & performance.

## Contributing

If you like, I can *auto-generate* a full Markdown README including badges (CI/CD, license, build status) and folder/layout / sample directories (e.g., `/frontend`, `/backend`, `/analytics`). Would that be helpful?
